## CDC Snapshot

A CDC snapshot in Databricks refers to a mechanism for implementing Change Data Capture (CDC) using periodic "snapshots" of source tables or databases. Instead of relying solely on transaction logs or database change data feeds, CDC from snapshots compares a series of full snapshots (i.e., complete copies of the source data at different points in time) to detect and process inserts, updates, and deletes.
